The Li1.5BP3DME10solutions were prepared in a glovebox filled with argon (O2<0.1 ppm, H2O <0.1 ppm). Lithium metal (China Energy Lithium Co. Ltd., China), biphenyl (alfa Aesar, China), and DME (alfa Aesar, China) were prepared according to the molar ratio of the Li1.5BP3DME10solutions. Then, biphenyl was dissolved in DME at ambient temperature in glass bottles to form transparent and colorless BP3DME10solutions. Finally, the lithium metal pieces were put into the BP3DME10solutions, followed by heating for 10 min in a 60 °C water bath.### Preparation of the Li7P3S11Pellet

Amorphous Li7P3S11powder was synthesized by two steps: first, the precursor was obtained by ball-milling Li2S (99.9%, Ganfeng Lithium) and P2S5(99.9%, Macklin) in a molar ratio of 7:3. Then the precursor was pressed into pellets, which were vacuum sealed in a quartz tube and heated at 260 °C for several hours. 150 mg of the Li7P3S11powder was pressed into a pellet under a pressure of 65 MPa. The diameter of the Li7P3S11pellet was 15 mm, and the thickness was 500 μm.### Synthesis of PEO-LiTFSI Precursor Solution

The PEO-LiTFSI precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PEO (Mw600000, Sigma Aldrich) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) (99%, INNOCHEM) in acetonitrile with an EO/Li mole ratio of 24:1 and stirring for 24 h.### Synthesis of Li7P3S11Pellet with LiF-Rich Protective Layer

1.722 g of LiTFSI was gradually added to 1 mL of DME and stirred for 10 h to obtain a clear and transparent LiTFSI (DME) solution of 6 M/L. The solution was added drop by drop between the lithium pellets and sulfide electrolyte pellets and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. Finally, the lithium pellets were peeled off to obtain sulfide electrolyte pellets with a LiF-rich protective layer.### Synthesis of Li7P3S11Pellet with PEO-LiTFSI Protective Layer

A 40 μL portion of PEO-LiTFSI precursor solution was dropped onto the surface of the Li7P3S11pellet and then casted uniformly with a doctor blade. The Li7P3S11pellets with the precursor solution were heated at 200 °C for 2 min to evaporate the acetonitrile solvent.### Synthesis of β-Li3PS4/S Precursor Solution

The precursor solution was prepared in three steps. (1) In the preparation of the polysulfide Li2S6solution, a 200 mg mixture of Li2S (44.65 mg, 99.9%, Ganfeng Lithium) and S (155.32 mg, 99.5%, Alfa) (molar ratio 1:5) was stirred in 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran (99.9%, Innochem), resulting in a reddish brown polysulfide Li2S6solution. (2) Meanwhile, a mixture of Li2S (22.35 mg) and P2S5(107.86 mg) (molar ratio 1:1) was stirred in 5 mL of acetonitrile (99.9%, Innochem), resulting in a yellow Li2S·P2S5solution. (3) The two solutions were mixed to form a homogeneous dark brown β-Li3PS4/S precursor solution. This precursor solution was prepared in an argon-filled glovebox (O2<0.1 ppm, H2O <0.1 ppm).### Synthesis of Li7P3S11Pellet with β-Li3PS4/S Protective Layer

The Li7P3S11pellets were first immersed into the β-Li3PS4/S precursor solution prepared by the dual-solution-mixing route, as mentioned above. Then, the pellets were slowly pulled up to form a thin layer of solution on the surface and naturally dried at room temperature in an argon-filled glovebox (O2<0.1 ppm, H2O <0.1 ppm). The dip-coating was repeated for different times (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 h). Finally, the pellets were heat-treated at 230 °C under argon for 1 h to complete the coating. Materials Characterization

XRD was conducted using an XD2 instrument (Beijing Purkinje) with a Cu radiator (1.54056 Å) at a voltage of 36 kV and a current of 20 mA. The scanning rate was 8°/min. The surface morphology of the samples was characterized by a field-emission SEM with an energy dispersive X-ray detector (HITACHI, SU8100). XPS (ULVAC-PHI, Inc., PHI 5000 VersaProbe III) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation was used to analyze the chemical composition of the SEI layer on the Li7P3S11sheet, and the binding energy was corrected by setting the binding energy of the hydrocarbon C 1s feature to 284.8 eV. TOF-SIMS (PHI nano TOF II) was used to analyze the chemical composition of the SEI layer of Li7P3S11sheet, PEO-LiTFSI interface layer, and β-Li3PS4/S interface layer. The TOF-SIMS instrument has Bi32+ ion species, 30 keV energy, and a current of 2 nA in acquisition phase, Ar ion species in sputter phase, and ∼10 nm/min SiO2standard sputtering time. All the samples were transferred with an air-proof sample holder to avoid air exposure.### Symmetrical Cell Assembly

All the preparation processes were performed in an argon-filled glovebox (O2<0.1 ppm, H2O <0.1 ppm). Preparation of homemade symmetric cell: 5 mL of Li1.5BP3DME10 solution was placed in two tanks of the homemade cell separately. The Li7P3S11 pellets with a PEO-LiTFSI and β-Li3PS4/S protective layer were placed in the middle of two tanks.Electrochemical cell testing: the galvanostatic charge–discharge test was carried out on a battery tester (CT2001, Land Ins., Wuhan, China) at a cutoff voltage between −5 and 5 V.Supporting Information
